# Challenge 2

Build a map of high bay using lidar and ros mapping software. Use a particle filter to localize in this map, using either lidar or vision.

## Approach

We use Hector SLAM for generating the map. For all details, have a look at indoor localization in [Challenge 3](../challenge3).
